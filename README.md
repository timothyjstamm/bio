# bio

After I left the University in 2014 I have been working on all sorts of research projects in the field of Physics & Mathematics. This had lead to a host of programming projects, mostly in Python. I have: Made three new types of AI (from scratch), made a Synaesthetic Signal Processor, a host of Physics simulations and a whole lot more. I will try to showcase the most interesting projects here.

I am currently employed by NewSkool in The Netherlands as a Data Science Trainee and would like to work in the (Python) Research & Development field!
